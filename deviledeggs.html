<h3>Bacon Cheddar Deviled Eggs</h3>

<p>
  These deviled eggs include bacon and shredded cheddar cheese. Better than your
  ordinary deviled eggs. <br />
  <br />
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>12 eggs</li>
  <li>Â½ cup mayonnaise</li>
  <li>4 slices bacon</li>
  <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons finely shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place eggs in a saucepan, and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil
    and immediately remove from heat. Cover, and let eggs stand in hot water for
    10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, and cool. To cool more quickly,
    rinse eggs under cold running water.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat
    until evenly brown. Alternatively, wrap bacon in paper towels and cook in
    the microwave for about 1 minute per slice. Crumble and set aside.
  </li>
  <li>
    Peel the hard-cooked eggs, and cut in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a
    small bowl. Mash egg yolks with mayonnaise, crumbled bacon and cheese. Stir
    in mustard. Fill egg white halves with the yolk mixture and refrigerate
    until serving.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Tips</h4>
<p>
  The magazine version of this recipe, scaled for half, uses pre-cooked bacon
  and increases the standing time to 15 minutes.
